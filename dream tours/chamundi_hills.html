        The Chamundeshwari Temple is a traditional Hindu temple located on the
        eastern edge of Mysore at the height of 1000ft on the Chamundi hills.
        Dedicated to and named after goddess Durga, the temple also has statues
        of Nandi and Mahishasura, the demon. Being one of the oldest temples in
        the palace city of Mysore, the temple is a must-visit attraction for the
        travellers. The Chamundeshwari Temple is considered as a Shakti Peetha
        and is one among the 18 Maha Shakti Peethas.There are two options for
        the visitors to reach the Chamundeshwari temple, either by steps or by
        driving through the interwoven valley road. The temple showcases the
        fierce form of Shakti, a tutelary deity that was held in reverence for
        centuries by the Maharajas of Mysore; hence deriving its name from
        goddess Durga. The idol of goddess Durga here is adorned every day and
        worshipped by a number of priests. The deity is offered a variety of
        fruits, coconuts and flowers to show respect and reverence.Located atop
        the Chamundi hills, the temple is usually not too crowded. The
        Chamundeshwari temple also has statues of the demon Mahishasura; you can
        even see the enormous statues from the way driving up to the temple. The
        temple also has a Nandi statue, which is that of a cow and holds great
        importance in the Hindu mythology. The view from the temple is stunning,
        as you can see many significant structures of the city including the
        Lalitha Mahal Palace. The temple has also been declared as the No
        Plastic Zone, thus making a huge contribution to the conservation of our
        environment by curbing the use of plastics and dumping of hazardous
        materials.<br />
