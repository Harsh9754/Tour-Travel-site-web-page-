      <p class="overview">
        An incredibly breathtaking example of Indo - Saracenic style of
        architecture, the Mysore Palace is a magnificent edifice located in
        Mysore in the state of Karnataka. Also known as the Amba Vilas Palace,
        it is the former palace of the royal family of Mysore and is still their
        official residence. Mysore Palace was built in the year 1912 for the
        24th Ruler of the Wodeyar Dynasty and is counted amongst one of the
        biggest palaces in the country.The construction of the Mysore Palace was
        orchestrated by the Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV referred as
        "Rajarishi" (saintly king) by Mahatma Gandhi. It was then further
        expanded by his son and the last Maharaja of Mysore, Maharaja
        Jayachamaraja Wadiyar. The facade of the palace is a harmonious blend of
        Hindu, Muslim, Rajput and Gothic styles which imparts it a regal
        quality. With the Chamundi Hills towards its eastern side, the spectacle
        of the Mysore Palace is an enchanting sight to behold. Needless to say,
        it is the second most visited historical monument visited by both local
        and foreign tourists after the Taj Mahal. Presently located inside the
        Old Fort, Mysore Palace is renowned for its light & sound show and
        vibrant Dussehra celebrations.
